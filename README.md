This RESTful API (CRUD) has been tested programmatically with <b>Playwright</b> and manually tested with <b>Swagger UI</b>. The database itself was seeded by running a simple T-SQL query in <b>Microsoft SQL Server Management Studio</b>.

  
For the time being, the API base URL is hardcoded to be `http://localhost:5000`
